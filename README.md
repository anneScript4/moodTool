# Hello, and welcome to The Mood Tool on GitHub!

## How are you feeling?

**The Mood Tool is a website where you're able to reflect on any emotion you might be having. Sometimes it's difficult to pin point a feeling you're experiencing, but with the help of The Mood Tool you get to interact with colors and illustrations to help you do that.**

Inspired by the work by Dr. Joan Rosenberg, whom encourages the importance of riding the wave of any emotion you might be experiencing, for at least 90 seconds.
